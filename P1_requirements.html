		<h2>Client</h2>
		<hr>

		<p class="lead_paragraph">Kari Øvernes, artist.

		<p class="lead_paragraph">To make an online portfolio and contact page for Kari Øvernes.
		<p>The purpose of making a website for this client is to make an online portfolio which can also be used as a contact page for potential buyers. Kari Øvernes already has an existing <a href="http://kariovernes.blogspot.no/" target="_blank">blog</a> which the website will be based on. The website will be a way for her to show off her works in the same sense as in a picture book, but online and with more interaction. Øvernes lives in a small community, so an online portfolio could expand her potential buyers as well.
		</p>

		<h2>Target group</h2>
		<hr>
		<p class="lead_paragraph">Potential buyers and people wanting to see the pictures. A Norwegian audience.
		<p>For the potential buyers every painting should be easy to view, and it should be easy to find information about the picture (prize, size, if the picture is sold or not). We also want to make it easy for the buyers to get in touch with the artist about purchasing a painting.
		<p>The other main target group are people clicking by wanting to look at her pictures. This group includes (but is not limited to): newer and more inexperienced painters wanting to see the works of a more trained painter, Øvernes' former teachers (using the pictures as an example of the work of one of their former students), and Øvernes' friends and family.
		<p>We focus on users with Norwegian as a main language, and because of that the content of the website will be written in Norwegian. This is a decision we have made in agreement with Øvernes, based on her preferences.
