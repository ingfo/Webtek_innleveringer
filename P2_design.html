				<h2>Administrative Details</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
					Client name: Kari Øvernes, self employed painter
					<br> Website Name: Kari Øvernes

				<h2>Purpose, Goals, and Audience</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>The purpose of making this website is to show Kari Øvernes’ works online in a portfolio format. It shall also be a way for buyers to get in contact with her about purchases or commissions. The goal for the website is to finish it by the end of November with specific elements:
			 	</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Optimize the experience of viewing the artworks</li>
					<li>Artworks will be in focus with a simple and intuitive layout</li>
					<li>Smaller devices with touch screens shall respond well to interaction</li>
					<li>Be easy to update</li>
					<li>Easy and intuitive to use for users in all age groups</li>
				</ul>
 				<p>
					The target group are potential buyers, people in need of inspiration and people that are curious about her work. It will be in Norwegian, as agreed with the client, and will therefore mainly attract a Norwegian speaking audience.

				<h2> Navigation Structure</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
					To present the material in the best way it was needed to make the page user friendly and easy to navigate. Thus the information architecture is pretty standard. The landing page you reach when entering the page will be the <b>Home</b> page. Here you will see a navigation menu with the <b>Elements Home (Hjem)</b>, <b>Gallery (Galleri)</b>, <b>Exhibitions (Utstilling)</b>, <b>About Kari (Om Kari)</b> and <b>Contact (Kontakt)</b>. There will be an underline to visualise which page you’re currently on. From either of those pages the navigation menu will be visible where you can reach each of the other pages. However there’s one exception to this navigation style. The sub-menu <b>Gallery</b> has a deeper level of navigation when each <b>individual image</b> is entered, and it can only be reached from the <b>Gallery</b> sub-page. The page is a combination of augmented linear structure with a bit of hierarchy to reach the <b>individual image</b>-view.

				<h2>Page Layout and Appearance</h2>
				<hr>
				<h3>The general layout of the page</h3>
					<p>
						The layout of the page is simple, and made to highlight the beautiful artwork of Kari Øvernes. The simplicity is also supposed to make the site straightforward and intuitive for the user. There aren't any subcategories; the only pages are the five different ones listed in the menu. They do not have any links. Therefore, every page will always be available from any of the pages, so that navigating will be easy for the user.
					<p>
						The paintings are going to stand out and be in focus by being colorful against a white or black background. This applies mainly for the home page and the gallery, but they will also appear on the other pages. The rest of the layout will be based on a flat design, where there are minimal disturbances to the artwork. A good use of white space will make the page tidy and light, especially on each of the sides.
					</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="img/hjem.jpg" alt="home">
					</figure>
					<figure>
						<img src="img/layout_blank.jpg" alt="layout blank">
					</figure>
					<p>
						The layout will have some differences between the wide version and the mobile version to fit the given format in the best way. Intuitive use and an optimal viewing experience is the reason they are different.
					</p>
					<figure class="mobil">
						<img src="img/mobil_hjem.jpg" alt="home mobile">
					</figure>

				<h3>Fonts</h3>
					<p>
						The font which will be used on the website is 'Open Sans'. It is a simple commonly used sans serif font. It is available in many different versions, such as light and bold, and works well on both titles and paragraphs. It is also easy to read which is also nice for an older audience. According to google fonts, it also has a fast load time, which is important on a website with many image files.
					</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="img/div/fonter.jpg" alt="fonts">
					</figure>

				<h3>Colors scheme</h3>
					<p>
						The page will have a simple color scheme with black and white accompanying the colors of the paintings. This way, the colors of the actual page will not interfere with the viewing of the artwork, and the pictures will stand more out. The pages will in general be white with black text, but sometimes white text will be put on top of images with a transparent black filter. This creates a dramatic effect and shows off both the artwork and the website. Text on the website will always be clearly distinguishable from the background so that it’s easy to read.
					<p>
						In addition to black and white, grey will be used to create a connection between the two. The chosen filter in the gallery will be a black text while the others are dark grey (#7F7F7F). The line under the signature at the top, and the line above the footer are both the same grey color.
					</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="img/galleri_filter.jpg" alt="gallery filter">
					</figure>

				<h3>Top Section</h3>
					<p>
						Most of the pages will have a similar top section with the name of the website, navbar and title of the page. The home page is the exception since it also has the purpose of introducing the site and the artwork (more about this in section 6).
					<p>
						The name of the website is displayed in  Øvernes’ own signature. This makes the site more personal and unique, compared to using a standard font. Below the signature is a thin line to separate the title from the content below.
					<p>
						The navbar has links to all the other pages. The links are written in bold and capital letters to make it stand out and separate them from other headlines. In the wide version the navbar is below the title. On the mobile version the navbar is stuck at the bottom of the window with white text on a slightly transparent black block. Navigating is thus made easier while scrolling on a small screen, and is commonly used in mobile applications. When hovering over the links, they will turn grey to indicate that it’s clickable. When it’s chosen it will be underlined.
					<p>
						The title of each page is also in bold, capital letters. The letters are more spaced out than in the other texts, and they are as large as the signature. This is for the user to know exactly what page it’s on.
					</p>

				<h3>Footer</h3>
					<p>
						The footer will only contain ‘copyright 2017’ and ‘Kari Øvernes’. Only one element will be in the footer, as an easy protection against website plagiarism. There are not that many site elements and the navigation system is straightforward, so it is not necessary to add a site map. Contact info is also to be found on the right side of the navbar, according to <a href="https://www.orbitmedia.com/blog/web-content-plagiarism/" target="_blank"> website standard</a>. Above the footer is a thin grey line to separate it from the content on the page. The line is like the one under the website title at the top, and together they frame the content of each page.
					</p>

				<h2>Content</h2>
				<hr>
				<h3>Home Page</h3>
					<p>
						The home page is the introduction to the website. This is the first time the user sees the artwork, therefore the page will have one of Øvernes’ paintings as the background, and her signature and the menu bar in white. In the wide version the background will change between four images, with 4 seconds between the changes. This shows a variety of artworks in a short time and introduces the different pages in the website.
					<p>
						On mobile, the background will not change and only use the elongated painting of the forest since it fits the mobile screen. As previously stated, the menu will be at the bottom on the mobile version. On the mobile version the menu is therefore identical on all the pages, including the home page.
					<p>
						Under the menu there will be an arrow pointing to the welcome message from Kari herself which will be in sight after scrolling down the page or clicking the arrow and be sent further down the page.

					<h3>Gallery</h3>
						<p>
							The gallery is the most important part of the website because this is where the artwork will be presented. The viewing experience is the key element and therefore the page has two different modes to view several artworks at once.
						</p>

						<div class="indentation">
							<h4>Default View</h4>
							<p>
								The default view is a list of smaller thumbnail images where all the images are cropped to squares. This gives a quick overview of the artwork and shows Øvernes’ art style. No information about the artworks is visible until you hover the mouse over an image (in the wide version). A black transparent filter will be on top of the image and the information will be in white text on top.
							</p>
							<figure>
								<img src="img/galleri_thumbnails.jpg" alt="gallery thumbnails">
							</figure>
							<p>
								Hover is not possible on a touch device so the information will appear when clicked on (in full screen view). In the wide version there are maximum six thumbnails in width. When the window is resized the number will be reduced, but they will always be in the middle of the window. On mobile it is always three thumbnails in width. Here the images will be smaller in smaller windows.
							</p>
							<figure class="mobil">
								<img src="img/mobil_galleri2.jpg" alt="gallery mobile">
							</figure>

							<h4>Second View</h4>
							<p>
								The other view mode shows the images larger, in their true format (not cropped), and has the information beneath them. All the images will have the same width, but the height will be different according to the format of that painting. On the wide version there will be two columns of images. The height will vary, so the grid will be very interesting to look at while maintaining both an organized pattern and the uncropped versions of the pictures. On the mobile version there will be only one image in width.
							</p>
							<figure>
								<img src="img/galleri_store.jpg" alt="gallery big">
							</figure>
							<figure class="mobil">
								<img src="img/mobil_galleri1.jpg" alt="gallery big mobile">
							</figure>

							<h4>Full Screen View</h4>
							<p>
								When a painting is clicked on, the full screen view will start, no matter which viewing mode it is seen in. The full screen view will have a transparent black background behind the painting, as to not loose track of where you are in the gallery. The information about the painting will be displayed under the painting in white text. There will be arrows on either side of the image in order to navigate as well as an X to exit full screen mode. It will also be possible to get to the next painting using the arrows on the computer's keyboard.
							</p>

							</figure>
						</div>

						<p>
							To make the viewing experience more seamless, not all the images will load in the gallery at once, but will continuously load as you scroll down. When the gallery page is first opened the window will fill with thumbnails/images, and scrolling down will lead to more images loading. Loading time for the page itself will take shorter time, and time is not wasted unnecessarily on loading images the user will not scroll down to.
						<p>
							The gallery will contain several different paintings and the filter will make it easier to sort out specific paintings. This way it is not necessary to scroll through all the paintings if only a certain category is of interest. The different categories are the four motives (“People and Nature”, “Temple Ruins”, “Ocean and Beach”, and “Abstract”) and the paintings that are for sale.
						</p>

					<h3>Exhibitions</h3>
						<p>
							The exhibitions page will show all the exhibitions Øvernes has held or attended, both previously and future ones. This way the viewer will know what the artist has done previously and will be able to attend future exhibitions. The page will have some pictures from exhibitions and paintings, and below it will be a list of exhibitions. The list will be sorted after the date it is held, the oldest ones at the bottom, and the future ones at the top. Each exhibitions will be presented on one line with year, name, date and location. When the user clicks one of the exhibitions more information will drop down.

					<h3>About Kari</h3>
						<p>
							This page will contain information about Øvernes and her work. Here the viewer can get to know the artist better and on a more personal level. It will contain her previous work, her occupation, art studies, other artistic work etc, but also more personal elements like a poem she is inspired by. Next to the text there will be an image of Kari in her painting studio. Among her previous work is a children's book she has illustrated. It will get its own paragraph and images from the book.

					<h3>Contact</h3>
						<p>
							The contact page is important for getting in contact with the artist, mainly for those who would like to purchase paintings. There will be a short text explaining how to get in touch under the title. Under the text her phone number will be shown and an email form that the viewer can fill out. The email address itself will not be available on the site to reduce the amount of spam mail the artist receives. As Øvernes is not on facebook and other social media there will not be links to such sites.

				<h2>Plan</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
					The content will be under all the submenus except for the gallery to be dynamically presented in <b>index.html</b>. This will be the best way to provide smooth transitions between the different sub-pages. It will also reduce the risk for file dependency issues and overcomplicate the project.
